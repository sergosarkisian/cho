  <title>Advanced MySQL and system command-line tools</title>
  <description>Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by Percona (http://www.percona.com/) support staff to perform a variety of MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented. They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
no libraries are installed. 

Percona Toolkit is developed and supported by Percona Inc.  For more information and other free, open-source software developed by Percona, visit http://www.percona.com/software/.
