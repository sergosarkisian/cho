=== kernel-debug ===
A Debug Version of the Kernel

This kernel has several debug facilities enabled that hurt performance.
Only use this kernel when investigating problems.

=== kernel-default ===
The Standard Kernel

The standard kernel for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.

=== kernel-pae ===
Kernel with PAE Support

This kernel supports up to 64GB of main memory. It requires Physical
Addressing Extensions (PAE), which were introduced with the Pentium Pro
processor.

PAE is not only more physical address space but also important for the
"no execute" feature which disables execution of code that is marked as
non-executable. Therefore, the PAE kernel should be used on any systems
that support it, regardless of the amount of main memory.

=== kernel-vanilla ===
The Standard Kernel - without any SUSE patches

The standard kernel - without any SUSE patches

=== kernel-xen ===
The Xen Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen paravirtualization.

This kernel can be used both as the domain0 ("xen0") and as an
unprivileged ("xenU") kernel.

=== kernel-ec2 ===
The Amazon EC2 Xen Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen paravirtualization.

This kernel can only be used as an unprivileged ("xenU") kernel
(mainly, but not exclusively, for Amazon EC2).

=== kernel-pv ===
The para-virtualized Kernel

The Linux kernel for Xen (and other) paravirtualization, using pv-ops
in the Xen/x86 case, in which case it can be used both as the domain0
("xen0") and as an unprivileged ("xenU") kernel.

=== kernel-lpae ===
Kernel for LPAE enabled systems

The kernel for all 32-bit ARM platforms that support LPAE. This includes all
Cortex A15 based SoCs, like the Exynos5, OMAP5 or Calxeda ECX-2000.

=== kernel-cubox ===
Kernel for SolidRun Cubox

The standard kernel for Marvell Dove SoC, as found in
the SolidRun Cubox.

=== kernel-exynos ===
Kernel for Samsung's Exynos SoC

The standard kernel for Samsung's Exynos 4 & 5 SoC, as found in the Origen board.

=== kernel-versatile ===
Kernel for Versatile SoC

The standard kernel for Versatile SoC, or for emulation with QEMU.

=== kernel-zfcpdump ===
The IBM System Z zfcpdump Kernel

The Linux kernel for booting the zfcpdump process on IBM System Z.

This kernel should only be used by the s390-tools package. This kernel
should not be installed as a regular booting kernel.

=== cluster-md-kmp ===
Clustering support for MD devices

Clustering support for MD devices. This enables locking and
synchronization across multiple systems on the cluster, so all
nodes in the cluster can access the MD devices simultaneously.

=== dlm-kmp ===
DLM kernel modules

DLM stands for Distributed Lock Manager, a means to synchronize access to
shared resources over the cluster.

=== gfs2-kmp ===
GFS2 kernel modules

GFS2 is Global Filesystem, a shared device filesystem.

=== ocfs2-kmp ===
OCFS2 kernel modules

OCFS2 is the Oracle Cluster Filesystem, a filesystem for shared devices
accessible simultaneously from multiple nodes of a cluster.

=== cluster-network-kmp ===
IP Virtual Server kernel modules

This package contains kernel modules for IP Virtual Server and the
CLUSTERIP netfilter target module.
